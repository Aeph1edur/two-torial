!!! info "Troubleshooting forums are available in our Discord server if you need direct help!"

!!! warning "This site is by no means all-encompassing"

    **We're only a group of volunteers aiming to bring you the most up-to-date information.**  

    But we're only humans, we make mistakes, and therefore:

    - Please **use a certain degree of caution** while manipulating your game files and **make backups**
    - Don't tamper with things if you don't know what you're doing

    If you can do that, these guides will probably be of use to you.  
    If not, **don't tell us we didn't warn you!**

!!! info "How to use the site?"

    On the left side is a navigation bar containing every guide:

    - **Games** category for game-specific guides on how to setup data, troubleshoot issues, etc.
    - **Error Codes** for a listing of known errors and what to do about them
    - **Game Patching** category for ways to patch/modify your game
    - **Extras** for anything that doesn't fit in the above categories
    - **Other Resources** for links to useful sites such as patchers, external guides, etc.

!!! info "Do you want to help us out?"

    Please check out our GitHub Repo by clicking the link at the top of right of the page.  
    Information on how to contribute is available there.
