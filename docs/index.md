!!! danger "Important"
    This site is by no means all-encompassing, I place emphasis on the need to engage in these guides with clean data from a trusted source.

    Please treat these games with some degree of respect and don't tamper with things if you don't know what you're doing, if you can do that, these guides will probably be of use to you. If not, I imagine you're beyond the help of the pages within, good luck.

### What do I need to know before starting?

!!! tip ""
    Before beginning with any of the guides on this site, please make sure your game files are from a clean and trusted source, also make sure you are using the latest version of whichever tools you have chosen, the guides on this website at the time of writing are using [SpiceTools](/extras/spiceguide/) ***with the exception of IIDX from 9th style up to Lincle which use Bemanitools.*** This will be stated on each individual game itself aswell.

### First time working with data?

!!! tip ""
    Check out the `First Time Setup` section of your respective game if you've never worked with BEMANI games before or if it's just been a while.

### Need help with error codes?

!!! tip ""
    Check out the [Error Codes](/errorcodes/) section for a list of the majority of error codes you may come across.
