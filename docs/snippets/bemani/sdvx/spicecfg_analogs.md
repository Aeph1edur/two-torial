	!!! tip "Bind your controller's knobs"

		With a controller, instead of binding to `VOL-L` and `VOL-R` in the `Buttons` tab, you need to:

		- Click `Bind`
		- In `Device`, pick your controller
		- In `Control`, pick `X` for `VOL-L` or `Y` for `VOL-R`
		- Turn your knob ensuring that the Preview knob turns along with it
		- Click `Close`, leaving the rest of the settings alone
		- Repeat for your other knob
