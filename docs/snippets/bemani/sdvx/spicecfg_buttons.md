    !!! info "Bind vs Naive"

        **Bind** - Use for controllers and hardware devices. **More responsive** and detects any HID device.  
        **Naive** - Use for device agnostic keyboard binds. **Less responsive** but works with simulated keystrokes.

    !!! tip "Binding your buttons" 

        Click on `Bind` then press the key you want associated with the action.

        With your controller and/or keyboard plugged in, configure your keys for:  

        - **Maintenance:** `Service, Test`
        - **Game buttons:** `BT-A, BT-B, BT-C, BT-D, FX-L, FX-R, Start`
        - **P1 Keypad**: `Keypad 0 to 9, Keypad Insert Card` 

        **Only if** you play with a keyboard:

        - **Knobs:** `VOL-L Left, VOL-L Right, VOL-R Left, Vol-R Right`
