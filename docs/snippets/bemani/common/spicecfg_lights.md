		Your controller might support having its lights controlled by the game through spice2x.

		If it does, here's how you may link different actions to your lights:

		- Click `Bind`
		- In `Device`, pick your controller
		- In `Light Control`, select the corresponding light
		- Click `Close`
		- Repeat for your other lights
