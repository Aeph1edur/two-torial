    !!! info "Bind vs Naive"

        **Bind** - Use for controllers and hardware devices. **More responsive** and detects any HID device.  
        **Naive** - Use for device agnostic keyboard binds. **Less responsive** but works with simulated keystrokes.

    !!! tip "Binding your buttons" 

        Click on `Bind` then press the key you want associated with the action.

        With your controller and/or keyboard plugged in, configure your keys for P1 and/or P2:  

		- **Maintenance**: `Service, Test`
		- **Game buttons**: `SW1 to SW7, Start, EFFECT, VEFX` 
		- **Keypad**: `Keypad Insert Card`, `1 to 9`

		**Only if** you play with a keyboard:

		- **Turntable**: `TT+, TT-` **and optionally** `TT+/-` which alternates between `TT+` and `TT-` on each press.
