    !!! info "Bind vs Naive"

        **Bind** - Use for controllers and hardware devices. **More responsive** and detects any HID device.  
        **Naive** - Use for device agnostic keyboard binds. **Less responsive** but works with simulated keystrokes.

    !!! tip "Binding your buttons" 

        Click on `Bind` then press the key you want associated with the action.

        With your controller and/or keyboard plugged in, configure your keys for P1 and/or P2:  

		- **Maintenance**: `Service, Test`
		- **Game buttons**: `Up, Down, Left, Right`
		- **Menu buttons**: ` Start, Up, Down, Left, Right`
		- **Keypad**: `Keypad Insert Card`, `1 to 9`
