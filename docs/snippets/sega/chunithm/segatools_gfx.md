        - Set `windowed` to `0` to run in fullscreen mode and `1` to run in windowed mode.
        - If you have multiple monitors and you're running in fullscreen mode (`windowed=0`),
        set `monitor` to the index of the monitor you want to run the game on.

    ??? info "Getting the monitor index"

        Navigate to Windows display settings. Each monitor should be assigned a number.
        The monitor index is that number minus one. For example, monitor 2 means monitor index 1.
