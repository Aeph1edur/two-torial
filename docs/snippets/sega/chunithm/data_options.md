!!! tip ""

    SEGA games receive content updates through option folders rather than direct game file updates.

    For CHUNITHM, official options are named `A???`, where `???` represents a sequence of numbers.  
    Community-created options often use letters instead of numbers to differentiate them from official releases.

    After downloading option files, extract them into your game's `Option` folder.

    ```
    📂amfs
    📂App
    📂AppData
    📂Option
    ┣━📂A001
    ┣━📂A121
    ┣━📂A131
    ┗━ etc..
    ```

!!! info "Option numbers don't always follow a sequential pattern<br>It's common to see the numbers jump, for example `A113` then `A121`"

!!! warning "The `A001` option folder may be required for network connectivity"
