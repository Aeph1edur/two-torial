!!! tip ""

    CHUNITHM content updates are distributed through option folders instead of patching
    the base game. They are named `A???`, with each `?` being a number. Custom options
    distributed by the community might use letters instead, to distinguish them from
    official ones.

    Extract any options you've downloaded into the `Option` folder. You should end up with
    a file structure as follows. **Do not be worried if you have fewer or more option folders.**

    ```
    ğŸ“‚A001
    ğŸ“‚A121
    ğŸ“‚A131
    ğŸ“‚A132
    ğŸ“‚A133
    ğŸ“‚A140
    ğŸ“‚A141
    ğŸ“‚A142
    ğŸ“‚A143
    ğŸ“‚A151
    ğŸ“‚A152
    ```
