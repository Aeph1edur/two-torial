    It is recommended that you follow along using a text editor with syntax highlighting such as [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/).

    Each following sub-section will correspond to a section in `segatools.ini`. If any
    section is not mentioned, you can skip them.

!!! warning

    If a key already exists in the section, delete everything after `=` and replace it with your
    setting. Do not add another key.

    ```ini
    [system]
    dipsw2=1
    dipsw2=1 ; WRONG!
    ```
