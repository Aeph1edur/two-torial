!!! danger "If your data doesn't look like this"

    If your data looks like the third example:

    - Create an `App` folder and move all files and folders from the image inside of it
    - Create empty folders named `amfs`, `Option` and `AppData` next to the `App` folder

    If extra directories or files are still present (executables, scripts, etc.), **remove them**.

    **This also indicates tampered data, we strongly recommend obtaining clean data from elsewhere.**
