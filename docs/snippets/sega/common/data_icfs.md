!!! tip ""

    Install Configuration Files (ICFs) tell the game what version it is.
    **Without this your game cannot go online!**

    **If your unprotected executables came with an `amfs` folder, and already has a file named `ICF1` in it, skip this step.**

    Otherwise, obtain copies of `ICF1` for your game version and place it in
    the `amfs` folder. If it is named something else, rename it to exactly
    `ICF1` **without any file extensions.**

!!! info "Showing file extensions"

    By default, file extensions on Windows are hidden. Enable them by navigating to
    the `View` tab in File Explorer and select `File name extensions`.
