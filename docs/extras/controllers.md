    **Recommended setup**: $425 (SANWA 50g, Omron 50g, default LEDs)
    
    This controller is widely considered the gold standard for IIDX controllers. With high-quality construction materials, a few spring and switch options, and an arcade-like textured turntable. The PHOENIXWAN's proven reliability makes it the top choice for both new and experienced players.

??? tip "DX6TH"

    <div class="controller-flex">
      <img class="controller-preview" src="/img/extras/controllers/iidx/yuancon_dx6th.png"">
      <div>

    [**Product listing**](https://yuancon.store/controller/IIDX){target="_blank"}  
    **Vendor**: [YuanCon](https://yuancon.store/){target="_blank"}  
    **Price range**: $209 ~ $334 + Shipping  
    **Recommended setup**: $334 (SANWA 50g, defaults)
    
    The DX6TH is a good alternative to the PHOENIXWAN, offering decent build quality at a lower price point. However, its glossy acrylic turntable attracts dust and fingerprints easily, and doesn't match the premium feel of the PHOENIXWAN's LMT surface. Additionally, YuanCon's customer support can be lacking for international customers due to language barriers.
