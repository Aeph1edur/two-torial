# Website DLL Patching

!!! info "Last updated: June 4th, 2024<br>Known web patchers: [External resources](/externalresources#web-patchers)"

!!! warning "For BEMANI games consider [Spice2x Patching](/extras/patchsp2x)"

	**This patching method is outdated for BEMANI games.**

	However spice2x patching is still very new and might not support your game yet, in this case follow this guide.

!!! danger "Before proceeding"

	**It is highly recommended to use an unpatched DLL as your base!**
	
	If you've already patched your game through other methods *([spice2x patching](/extras/patchsp2x) or [hex editing](/extras/hexguide))*,  
	**Please replace your game's DLL with the original**.

### Getting started

!!! tip ""

	We'll be using mon's [BemaniPatcher](https://mon.im/bemanipatcher).  
	Almost every other patcher is based off of this and functions exactly the same.   

	**If your game is recent, please check [External resources](/externalresources#web-patchers) and use another web patcher.**

	Go to your chosen patcher's website, you'll get something similar to this:

!!! tip ""

	Click on any game you'd like the patches for. In this case, we'll use Beatmania IIDX 30 Resident.

!!! tip ""

	Here, either:

	- Drag and drop the `.dll` file the site prompts you to use.
	- **OR** click on `Choose a file` and select it that way.

	If you've used the correct file and the site is compatible, it will tell you.

	`X of X patches matched (100%)` means the patcher is compatible with your game.  
	**If this shows any less than 100%, DO NOT use it, find another patcher.**

	**Please keep in mind that some patchers may not support the most recent versions of your game right away.**

	Now, you can select the patches you'd like to apply. 
	
	If you're unsure on what to do, refer to your specific game's guide as it might have more information there.  
	Otherwise feel free to join our Discord server, the link is at the top of the [home page](/), and ask the community!

	When you're done selecting patches, click on `Save Patched File` and your new `.dll` file will start downloading.

!!! danger "Backup your original `.dll` file first!"

!!! tip ""

	Now you may replace your data's `.dll` file with the patched one you just downloaded.

	Once you've done that, you're done. Enjoy!
