# How to use Patcher Websites

!!! tip ""
	For this guide, I'll be using mon's [BemaniPatcher](https://mon.im/bemanipatcher) as almost every other patcher is based off of this and functions exactly the same. You can find a list of patchers in [here.](../externalresources.md#patcher)

	When opening the Patcher website, you'll be at this screen:

	Next, click on any game you'd like the patches for. In my case, I'll use beatmaniaIIDX Resident.

	Once here, simply drag & drop the `.dll` file the site prompts you to use into the website or click on `Choose a file` and select it that way.

	If you have inserted the correct file, the site will tell you which data code is used. Please keep that in mind when trying to patch n-0 data, as some sites may not have the most recent data code available right away.

	Now, you can select the changes you'd like to apply. If you're unsure on what certain things do, feel free to [join the Discord server](https://discord.gg/cZRUmEPK78) and ask away as making an explanation for every game on what every hex edit does would be a bit too much.

	When you're done doing your changes, simply click on `Save Patched File` and the website will download your patched `.dll` file.

	Next, **backup your original `.dll` file** and replace it with the old one.
	When you've done that, you're done. Enjoy your game!
