### DirectSound

!!! tip ""

    The legacy Windows audio system, still used by older games.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Pros**:

      - Extremely high compatibility, especially with older games
      - Multiple audio sources can play simultaneously
      - Easy audio capture with OBS, Discord etc.
      - Simple to set up and use

    ‚ùå **Cons**:

      - Highest latency of all modes
      - Being phased out in favor of WASAPI
      - Limited audio quality compared to modern modes

### WASAPI Shared

!!! tip ""

    The modern Windows standard audio mode. Recommended for most users.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Pros**:

      - Works with most modern games and applications
      - Multiple audio sources can play simultaneously
      - Easy audio capture with OBS, Discord etc.
      - Good balance of latency and compatibility

    ‚ùå **Cons**:

      - Higher latency than Exclusive mode
      - Some games may require patches/configuration for Shared mode

    üí° **Pro tip**: Use spice2x's `-lowlatencysharedaudio` setting to reduce latency.

### WASAPI Exclusive

??? warning "Hardware compatibility notice"

    Your audio device must explicitly support exclusive mode. Check your audio settings:

    <img src="/img/common/audio_exclusive.png">

!!! tip ""

    Gives one application complete control over the audio device.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Pros**:

      - Significantly lower latency than Shared mode
      - More consistent audio processing than Shared mode
      - Better for rhythm games if you don't mind the cons

    ‚ùå **Cons**:

      - Only one application can output audio at a time
      - No audio capture without special hardware/software
      - Can cause system-wide audio interruptions

### ASIO

!!! warning "Hardware requirements"

    For optimal results, use a dedicated ASIO-compatible audio interface. Software solutions like [ASIO4ALL](https://asio4all.org/) or [FlexASIO](https://github.com/dechamps/FlexASIO) exist but have limitations:

    - Add processing overhead
    - May not improve latency over WASAPI Exclusive
    - Best used when:
        - Games are incompatible with your audio device
        - ASIO is the only supported mode
        - You need specific ASIO features

!!! tip ""

    Professional audio standard designed for audio interfaces and music production.

    ‚úîÔ∏è **Pros**:

      - Lowest possible latency when properly configured
      - Direct hardware control
      - Precise buffer size adjustment
      - Professional-grade audio quality
      - Bypass Windows audio stack
	  - Capture is possible when routed through VoiceMeeter at the cost of very little added latency

    ‚ùå **Cons**:

      - Requires specialized hardware for best results
      - Complex setup process
      - Usually limited to one application at a time
      - No direct audio capture support
      - System performance heavily impacts stability
      - May require significant tweaking
