# About this site

!!! quote "Notes from the original author"

	This site was written by a IIDX player with the help of a few prominent friends. One day I hope to match their intellect, wish me luck.

	The philosophy behind writing these guides and the information contained within is to remove repetitive troubleshooting. By this point, every server has answered the same questions over and over again, hundreds of times. Maddening to see over the years, don't you think?

	While a search function may be present across several communities, it is often unused by users, something I have never found an answer as to why, but my hope is that I can confidently link specific sections of this site to resolve 99% of issues people bring up until it becomes the norm. Each beginner setup guide is built to minimalize user interaction with the data itself, and to keep things simple via hand-holding. For example, with modern improvements to tools, games can now be ran successfully without the user ever touching a single file from the game's data. Days have long past for users incorrectly modifying their ea3-config.

	Still, as long as this website helps even 1 user enjoy these games, then its goal has been met. Whether it be within the first hour of its posting, or years later, I will be satisfied if I meet that goal.

	My philosophy stays the same as from the original author. I've seen how much effort and care has gotten into it and in my opinion, it would be a shame to let it all go to waste. That's why I've decided to pick it up from the dead, host it and hopefully maintain it.

	The original author and creator has given me full permission to use his previous work and edit it as I please.
