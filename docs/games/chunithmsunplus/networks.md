# CHUNITHM SUN PLUS Network Setup

<img src="/img/chunithmsunplus/sunplus.png">

## Why would you want to use a server?

!!! tip ""
    While CHUNITHM can be run offline, connecting to a server gives you the ability to create a profile, save scores, and even unlocks additional features.

## ARTEMiS

!!! tip ""
    -harder to setup, works better once setup.  
    https://gitea.tendokyu.moe/Hay1tsme/artemis  
    check supported game list  
    read install documents relevant to your desired setup (windows/linux)  
    read game specific instructions to make sure you have configured the server correctly for your game data, and that your game data has been imported to the server  

    while artemis is stable and fine for local use, it is still very much in active development, and as such, the installation procedure is likely to change.  
    due to this, i'm unable to provide a step by step setup guide on this page.

## AquaDX

!!! tip ""
    -ez mode setup, requires messing with game files to actually work. relys on updates from devs for future content.  
    https://github.com/hykilpikonna/AquaDX  
    install java jdk, make sure java is enabled on windows PATH  
    click code > download zip  
    extract to its own folder, NOT into your \app\bin folder  
    go to releases and download the latest .jar, place it in the folder you extracted the previous files too  
    go into config folder, configure application.properties file  
    run start.bat  

## Online Hosted Servers

!!! tip ""
    aqua.msm.moe - does it even support sun plus?  
    other 'public' all.net servers, doubt any would want to be linked here, as most required being invited by an existing member. ask your friends!
