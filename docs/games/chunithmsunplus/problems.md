audio stuff
-game uses exclusive audio by default. can patch shared audio but need to set sound card default format (different from konami games). also increases latency.

English Patch (not sure if/how distribution?)

Card reader setup?  
-aic pico/real aime reader (ez)  
-cardio (dlls)

multiplayer setup instructions  
-zerotier pain in the ass, but works.

DXVK (run game on vulkan)  
-lets you tab out of fullscreen without crash  
-possibly runs better for some people

slow boot times
