### Clock error

!!! tip ""

    In the test menu, navigate to `CLOCK`, and set it to match your computer's time.

### The game is running slow/lagging

!!! tip ""

    Try to eliminate any unnecessary background processes during play.

### Unable to login / Eamuse error / Network error

!!! tip ""

    Get the proper Asphyxia plugin from our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/cZRUmEPK78) in the #ddr channel > Resources post.
    Make sure you didn't enable `-smartea` in spicecfg's options.

### After choosing a song, the game freezes on the loading screen

!!! tip ""

    There are two possible reasons for this. Either you may not have properly registered your codecs, or it's possible that your network doesn't support your game version.

### Where are the option for Dancers/Shading/Measure lines/Fast-Slow/Layering?

!!! tip ""

    These options are locked behind network requirements and will not be displayed unless you are connected to a network that has written support for these options. Patches are available to mitigate this, see our [spice2x Patching guide](/extras/patchsp2x.md).
