<img src="/img/taikonijiiro/taikonijiiro.png">

## Why would you want to use a server?

!!! tip ""
    While Nijiiro can be run offline, connecting to a server gives you the ability to create a profile, save scores, and unlock additional features.

## Online Hosted Servers

!!! tip ""
    There are a few online hosted servers that support Nijiiro, however most of them are currently invite only. Ask your friends where they play, and maybe they'll invite you!

### Elara Global Taiko Server

!!! tip ""
    [EGTS](https://egts.keitannunes.ca/guide) is the only public Nijiiro server that also comes with an omnimix that includes custom songs and songs from other taiko games. 

## Self hosted local servers

!!! tip ""
    If you wish to run the game locally, but with the ability to create and save a profile, you can run a server on the same computer you are playing the game on. This server will need to be running before you launch the game, however it can be shut down when you are no longer playing.

    Please refer to the included setup instructions on each projects respective web page.

### TLS

!!! note ""
    [TLS](https://github.com/asesidaa/TaikoLocalServer/tree/Refactor) - A network service emulator for Nijiiro.

!!! tip ""
    Setup can be complex as you are required to build TLS from source using [VisualStuido](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) and `.sln` files.
