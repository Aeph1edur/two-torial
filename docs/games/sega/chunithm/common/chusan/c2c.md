# Cab-to-Cab over Internet

!!! danger "You are most likely to have success with Multiplayer when all users are using the SAME data and options, from the same sources. Verify that each person can run the game normally before attempting to network them together."

## Initial setup

!!! tip "Network"

    Every machine needs to be on the same LAN.  
    If you wish to achieve that over the internet, follow the [ZeroTier setup guide](/extras/zerotier.md).

!!! tip "GAME ASSIGNMENTS"

    - Open the Service Menu and navigate to `GAME ASSIGNMENTS`

    - Make sure all machines are on the same group (Group A for example)
    <img src="/img/sega/chunithm/common/c2c/group.webp">

    - Set one machine to `STANDARD`, and all other machines to `FOLLOW THE STANDARD`

    <img src="/img/sega/chunithm/common/c2c/followstandard.webp">

    Exit the Service Menu and load into Attract Mode. If the game passes the Group Check then chances are you're good to go! You can now login to a credit and open a cab-to-cab link request to check if the connection is working properly!

## How to link?

!!! Info "If you're new to CHUNITHM and have never tried link-play before and you have no idea how, keep reading"

    - Login to a credit

    - If you're hosting a cab-to-cab session, choose a song first, then scroll to the far left and press `Confirm`  
    The cab-to-cab request is now open

    - If you're connecting, navigate to the `Cabinet-to-Cabinet Play` tab and wait for other players to create a session

    If you are able to see each other's session, congrats! You can now enjoy some cab-to-cab chain action!
